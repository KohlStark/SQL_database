# My own SQL database
Included in this project are a number of SQL files which contain the scripts to create tables, insert to them, query them, and drop them.
The database being created is one that represents a restaurant. The database is formated to store information about tables in the restaurant,
as well as the restaurants staff.

The file to create the tables is named ddl.sql which contains the scripts to create the appropriate tables. Once the tables have been created
the insert.sql will insert four peices of sample data into each table and update two peices of information from it as well. Once the tables 
have been populated, it is possible to run a query.sql file to query specific information from the now created database. A query.sql file
is contained in this project and shows three specific examples. Also contained in this project is a drop.sql to drop the tables after
there is no longer a need for them. The run.sql is a file that contains to the script to run all of these files in unison and the output
of running this file is contained in the output.txt file.

Lastly, contained in this file is a ER_Diagram photo of how I visualized the database before preceeding to code it out. Each one of the
small tables represents a table I created in the ddl.sql file and the lines are the relations that each table has to one another.
Each entry that is underlined represents a primary key in the table.

Thanks for reading!
